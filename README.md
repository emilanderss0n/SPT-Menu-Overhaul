Replace the extremely uninspiring main menu that's in the game by default. Your player is added to the first menu screen. Comes with a lot of options in the F12 menu to place things where you want. You can also rotate the player through this menu. It will remember your settings for when you load the main menu again.

If you use this mod and do NOT use the Factory theme, then don't go looking for support in the discord if you get errors in logs. You will only waste people's time. But if you want to experiment go ahead, but at your own risk.

Install the mod by dragging the first folder in the zip into your SPT install directory. Huge thanks to GrooveypenguinX for all the help and ability to look at your initial version of this menu. I also want to thank the SPT modding community in Discord. This is a WTT release.
