# MenuOverhaul

MenuOverhaul is a BepInEx plugin designed to enhance and customize the main menu interface of the game. It provides users with options to change the visual appearance of the menu, including background elements, player model display, UI positioning, and lighting effects. 

Install the mod by dragging the first folder in the zip into your SPT install directory. Huge thanks to GrooveypenguinX for all the help and ability to look at your initial version of this menu. I also want to thank the SPT modding community in Discord. This is a WTT release.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to apply the Factory theme in the game menu before installing this mod.
